# Changelog

## v0.2.8 (2026-02-05)
- Batch Out backups: configurable daily time with auto backup to ProgramData/backups plus manual "Batch Out" control in EOD window; backups stored alongside last-run metadata.
- EOD settings now store batch-out preferences; renderer can see last batch-out timestamp and trigger backups directly.

## v0.2.7 (2026-02-05)
- New End of Day window with autosaved settings, date-range summaries, and email sending; exposed via IPC/preload and toolbar shortcut.
- Toolbar polish: neon Generate Quote call-to-action on the left; Technicians, EOD, Calendar, and fullscreen controls grouped on the right.
- Customer Overview autosave now validates contact details, creates new customers when needed, and supports close-on-save behavior reliably.
- Work order child windows respect closeParent only for spawned dialogs; release form wording consolidated in the final block.

## v0.2.6 (2026-02-03)
- Keep release print to one page: two-column items when long, notes/checklist/terms/signature stay together.
- Show selected device category in the picker and feed it through to printouts.
- Technician lists refresh live (assignment dropdown, filters, tables, unified list) when new techs are added.
